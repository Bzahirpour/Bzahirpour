<h1>Hi, I'm Ben! I'm a Senior NOC Technician, aspiring Network Engineer, and a recent graduate with a Bachelors in Network Engineering and Security. I work on things like automation, Ansible, Linux, Bash, and Python in my free time. Check out my page for updates on my projects and studies!

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Projects:</h2>

- [Engineering My Own Network](https://github.com/Bzahirpour/Network-Design/tree/main) <br>I built my own network for fun, then when I got to my Capstone we needed to submit a network design so I used the one I had already built. I had an absolute blast working on this project, and it was a way bigger undertaking than I orginally thought. Working on this project has given me a whole new respect for network engineers and architects. Here you can see my network design, along with a full write up about it and all the config files for the network devices!<br>
- [Java Based Keylogger](https://github.com/Bzahirpour/Key-Capture) <br>Here is a simple keylogger I wrote to futher my understanding of advisarial tactics, and to spread community awareness.
